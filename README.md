# Firebase Push Notifications

Push Notifications With React AndÂ Firebase

How to receive push notifications

Push notifications are small pop-up messages sent to a user's device or web app that appear even when the app is not open. They can alert real-time updates or changes to their upcoming plans, bookings, deliveries, and other time-sensitive topics.Â 

So I'm interested how we can easily add receiving push notifications to our web app. In today's tutorial, I'm going to do it through Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). It is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets you reliably send messages at no cost.
